USER STORIES/BUSINESS RULES

- Only recipe owner can modify the ingredients and recipe content (but maybe find a way to allow them to make notes in their copy of the recipe or something, so they can effectively alter their own version, say if they like to add carrots to the recipe or something, but not have it affect the actual recipe).

- Comments for recipes that everyone can see.

- Notes for recipes that only the note creator can see.
